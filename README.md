# Cif2022

This repository contains the code from the lecture and any code required for the homework by Eran Fishler.

This branch has been configured in IntelliJ IDE with Java 18 (not chosen by me) Liberica (for Apple Silicon compatibility) and can be run in local directly.

**DO NOT DO NOT DO NOT DO NOT DO NOT** switch to main branch in local as such attempt will ruin the workspace and disable VCS integration.
