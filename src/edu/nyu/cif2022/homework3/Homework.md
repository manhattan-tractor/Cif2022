Homework #3
===========

Question #1

In this homework we are going to create a zero garbage priority queue. 
At class we discussed we created a node class to implement a linked list.
In this homework we will build a priority queue and test it.
Recall that priority queue contains elements that could be compared with each other.
This comparison operation allows us to sort the elements by priority.
I have created an interface PriorityQueue that you need to implement.
You need to implement ZGPriorityQueue and ZGPriorityQueueTest only.
The rest is already done.
Note that our queue will work with the Integer class out of the box, so you can use Integer
for testing, see ZGPriorityQueueTest
